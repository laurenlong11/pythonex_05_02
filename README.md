Python For Everybody Exercise 5-02
5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.

Desired Output:
Invalid input
Maximum is 10
Minimum is 2

I am getting:
Invalid input
Maximum is 7
Minimum is 10

I made it print along the way so I can see where it's going wrong, but I'm not sure why it's thinking 10 is less than 2 and 4?
